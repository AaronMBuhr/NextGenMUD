        name: South Dark Forest Road
        description: >
          A narrow, winding path shrouded in shadows, marking the southern entrance to the dark forest. The dense canopy overhead allows only slivers of moonlight to penetrate, casting eerie patterns on the ground. The air is thick with the scent of moss and damp earth. An unsettling silence pervades, broken occasionally by distant, unidentifiable sounds.
