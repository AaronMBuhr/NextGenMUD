          In a secluded corner of an ancient forest lies a mystical glade, a hidden
          sanctuary bathed in a soft, ethereal light that seems to weave through the
          air like a gentle mist. This enchanted clearing is encircled by venerable
          trees of immense age, their trunks gnarled and thick, rising high into the
          sky. Their branches, heavy with luminous leaves, intertwine above, creating
          a natural dome that filters sunlight into a kaleidoscope of gentle greens and golds.

        name: Crystal Cave
        description: >
          Hidden within the Enchanted Forest lies the Crystal Cave, a mesmerizing subterranean wonder.
          Upon entering, one is immediately enveloped by a kaleidoscope of light, as countless crystals
          embedded in the walls and ceiling catch and refract the faintest of lights. These crystals
          range in color from deep amethyst to the clearest diamond, creating a dazzling display that
          seems almost otherworldly. The air inside is cool and carries a faint, mineral scent, echoing
          with the soft, melodic dripping of water. Delicate crystal formations grow from the floor,
          creating an intricate maze that leads deeper into the heart of the cave.
