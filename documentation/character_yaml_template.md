## Notes on Multiclassing

1. Characters can have up to 3 classes (primary, secondary, tertiary)
2. Each class has independent level progression
3. Class priority determines which class benefits apply at full strength vs. reduced strength
4. Some skills and abilities may require a class to be the primary class to function at full effectiveness
5. XP is shared across all classes, but each class levels independently
